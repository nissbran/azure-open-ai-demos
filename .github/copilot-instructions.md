## Libraries and Frameworks

- .NET: A free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications.
- OpenTelemetry: A set of APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation to provide observability for applications.
- Java: A high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

## Architecture

The demo applications are built as console chat applications that interact with Azure OpenAI services. They demonstrate various features such as chat completions, function calling, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and integration with Azure AI Search and Azure AI Foundry.
