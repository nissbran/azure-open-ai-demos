## Code coverage template

This document outlines the structure and steps to set up a CI/CD pipeline for code coverage for GitHub actions.

### Workflow Structure
This is the suggested directory structure for the workflow file:
```
.github/workflows/
├── ci-code-coverage.yml   # CI workflow for code coverage
```

### Template to follow

This is a template for a GitHub Actions workflow that performs code coverage analysis for .NET projects. It checks out the code, sets up the .NET environment, downloads test results, combines coverage reports, and publishes the results.

```yaml
